<h3><font color="#F54E57">The Third Culture</font></h3><p> 2002 Juni specce at professor Ib Madsens 60 birthday<br><br><strong>Dear mathematicians, dear friends, dear friends of Ib and dearest Ib</strong><br><br>What I am going to say now is not scientifically proofed<br>It's hands on experience<br>It's lived life- 33years and it's interpretations of what great men and women have saidIn 1959 in Cambridge CP Snow held some famous lectures called &quot; Two Cultures<br><br>He said: The number two is a very dangerous number, and that's why dialectic is such a dangerous proces, but he insisted in giving a picture of the divided educational system, that he thought brought divided knowledge to our world.<br>What I think he had was a tremendous intuition and understanding for<br>was the rise of, what years later was to be called the Third Culture,<br>that science need to know Humanities and Humanities need to know<br>science. And thereby get rid of our pole-thinking, and according to<br>Snow in order to make the resources of the world available for all.<br>A divided worldconception just makes us more dull than we need to be, CP Snow ,<br>Or let me bring your attention to Richard P Feyndman, from his book<br>Surely your joking Mr. Feyndman; he kept looking up different worlds,<br>the deaf party, the biologists at Caltech, the philosophers, the<br>psychologists, the artists, the drummers and of course the women<br>always in order to expand his different lives or say perspectives<br>which according to himself inspired his ability to create and see<br>forth new solutions and answers to his own field of physics.</p><p>I Don't know much about infinite loop spaces,<br>I don't no much about high dimensional spheres,<br>I don't know much about equivarians,<br>I don't know much about finite groups that act freely and liniarly,<br>but I do know that I like the taste of these words in my mouth. And<br>when I on Tuesday left, this world of not knowing, I felt blessed<br>that exactly that crowd of people, exactly those areas of the<br>mathematical world , that exactly that science is in these worlds of<br>mine.<br>Surely you people are just doing your job as mathematicians,<br>but for me your expanding the infinite field of knowledge.<br>For that I am grateful.</p><p>In times of complexity and unpredictability like the one we are<br>conscious of living in these times,<br>I keep seeking in my most inner and my most outer beliefs for a way<br>of seeing, hearing, touching, dancing, mentally coping with,<br>emotionally dealing with ways of getting through to the other side of<br>any complex equation I stand in front of in my all so tiny life.The other day when I joined Gunner's lecture on the mathematical<br>conquests co-created by Ib and several others of his colleagues, I<br>had this very immense feeling that I was participating in another<br>world, I didn't get much of it.<br>To put it honestly, it bothered my deeply, especially when four or<br>even five of the people attending the seminar suddenly started<br>laughing at a point Gunner made.<br>I was definitely in another world.<br>A different language, a different style different clothing- and it<br>wasn't streetstyle ruling here, different presentation techniques and<br>a different ambience.<br>That Tuesday night I was sitting in my sofa feeling very lucky and<br>fortunate to know Ib. Because I suddenly understood that knowing him<br>created the possibility, among all possibilities present in this<br>universe, for me to attend a different world than my own that day.<br>A dear friend of mine said to my for some time ago: we need not say<br>the same in order to understand the same!<br>That lecture by Gunner made me think the following thoughts:<br>We conceive and attract different kind of knowledge in our way through life,<br>the crux of matter for me though is that when we dig into this<br>infinite pool of knowledge we do it in order to expand our mental<br>bandwidth.<br>And maybe one of the reasons why we don't have to say the same in<br>order to understand the same, is that the essence of what knowledge<br>is about, is that all knowledge might be connected in an yet unseen,<br>unknown, un-equatinized field- of all knowledge. And that the purpose<br>of the process of knowing is, maybe, as humans to enable our souls to<br>live more lives atthe same time.<br>And again that made me think that:<br>I know that I need more than one reality to cope with life and<br>therefor need more than one knowledge.<br>And how knowledge maybe the main ingredient in the ability of<br>sampling our realities into a new wholeness.<br>And thereby we enable ourselves to live our lives with broader<br>minds, an open hearts and with the ability to grab the responsibility<br>that knowledge brings.<br>We can not escape the mere fact that knowledge will make us free,<br>even though we at times feel more captured and more disillusionized.<br>My parents said to me, quoting the Coran, you can do a lot of things<br>with knowledge you can even misunderstand and misinterpret it, but<br>you can also do and be in your life at your fullest, so get down to<br>the 'home work now- later they shorten it and just said: take a pen<br>and free your mind-I was in fifth grade and din't get it!<br>My point is that as humans in this world in this universe we do live<br>more lives at the same times, simultaneously, and I strongly believe<br>that we need to be conscious about it in order to achieve from it and<br>use it. We need to expand our mental bandwidth.<br>And that our capacity as humans to deal with a multidimensional world<br>every second is our chance to enhance, to develop, to create new<br>thinkings and new perspectives on our civilizations.<br>The third culture for me is a state of mind- its away of being.<br>It's a a way of living life at it's most beautiful, most lively, most<br>demanding form, and by bringing the field of mathematics into mine<br>and other of the friends here today, lives -<br>you Ib have a certain ability of bringing forth what I would call<br>the third culture.<br>I feel blessed as a human being taken part of this world creation and<br>having the possibility, and the chances in the infinite space to see,<br>experience, not-understand, hear and sense different worlds at one<br>time.So for me this celebration to day is a celebration of the possibility<br>that more worlds than two can be present at the same time, that it<br>can add value of infinite quality, and for that I thank you Ib who<br>brought this group together this week.<br>Simply you are ever enlarging my lives<br>Ladies and gentlemen let's broaden our minds!</p>
