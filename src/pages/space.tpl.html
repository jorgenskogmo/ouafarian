<h3><font color="#F54E57">Space is the place</font></h3><p> <br>En tanke bunke maj 2003 af Ouafa Rian<br><br><br><strong> SPACE IS THE PLACE</strong></p><p>The question moving my heart these times is:<br>How do we as a civilization enable our selves to keep enlarging the<br>worlds we are living?<br>How do we create a mindshift from a linear to a nonlinear thinking<br>that will allow us to use fully the abundance of life that complexity<br>holds in awe for us?<br>For me the half degree mindshift towards living within the complexity<br>consciously is a lever to design for long term sustainability for<br>humanity.</p><p>All I am going to say for the next 20minutes are an aspect of how can<br>we as humanity enlarge the world, and therby how can we expand our<br>knowledge, our hearts, our minds.<br>That space is magical to me.<br>I believe that in expanding our understanding of what space is we<br>will be better of living within it and with all its qualities.What I am going to say now is not scientifically proofed. Its hands<br>on experience<br>It's lived life- 34 years<br>And its interpretations of what great men and women have said<br>Infinity is spatial, and thereby bodily anchored. Senses, feelings,<br>Infinity is infinite, is complex (many parts created a number going<br>towards infinity of combinations, chess), holds chaotic conditions<br>and IS holding the field of all possibilities.<br>Eternity is timely, or say timebased and thereby mentally anchored.<br>We live time in a linear fashion.<br>One of the reasons why we don't get our actions right- if we act at<br>all- is that we act in a linear fashion in a nonlinear world read Nature<br><br>So my question these times is:<br>Are we limiting ourselves as human beings, and thereby excluding<br>ourselves from new insights, smells, colors, feelings, solutions and<br>new questions by the mental abstraction- some might even say<br>illusion- of time?<br>And my heart is trying to see into infinity to try and reveal some<br>new insights to help us gain a broader view on reality, to enlarge<br>our worlds and expand our minds and whole our bodies.Infinity:<br>A characteristic of infinity is that it holds complexity, holds chaos<br>in its scientific definition: a condition within the system that is<br>unpredictable yet not coincidental,<br>And that is has the character of the field of all possibilities<br>within its geometric structure.<br><br>That field is very intriguing to me: it's an organizational structure<br>that holds all knowledge in the universe!<br>That means that what we have here now on planet earth might be a<br>small sample of the infinity's pool of knowledge, and to me asking<br>questions that gets us to open up for even more of that pool is a<br>driving force for the work I do within organizations.<br>In moving towards an insight of infinity and thereby space were we<br>act upon a nonlinear, complex, with chaotic conditions that requires<br>acting through choices, that would make us, more in tune, more<br>connected to the web of life.<br>And the web of life has over and over again through out evolution<br>proofed its ability to create, generate and always organizing towards<br>a higher level of order, complexity and diversity, in beauty, in the<br>most simple way.<br>&auml; And the seasons know exactly when to change&auml;<br>To touch the pool of infinite possibilities we need to dare make a<br>choice and act upon the responsibility our life came with.<br>Actions and moves made by us through a choice will create access to<br>the treasures of space-time.<br>We need a clock of the long now, which is a spatial time, where the<br>now is long, wide, deep, large, tall and we become connected in there.<br>We need bodily anchored space to connect with infinity and thereby<br>connect to the complexity and chaos that the universe uses as a<br>design principle for emergence<br>Being in an infinity mindscape means to me to be able to live more<br>lives at once, to gain from all the possibilities, and to allow the<br>&quot;best working&quot; solution to appear by itself, for itself, with itself<br>helped by the attention our minds can offer<br>This only requires our ability and courage to make decisions, to make<br>a choice, to select one thing from the other, to dare the choice and<br>act upon it<br>IN ACTING WE AVOID THE PARALYSE AND TEHREBY STRAT AGAIN IN BRINGEING FOR THE WORLD ANEW, JUST LIKE MATURANA AND VARELA HAVE PREDICTED YEARS AGO:<br>THE WORLD DOENST EXIXT WE BRING it forth.<br>OUR ABILITY TO SEE NEW, HEAR NEW IS ALWAYS NEEDED to enlarge the world.<br>To make a deep choice in the recognized pool of all possibilities is<br>the true endeavor we are standing in front.<br><br>So to end this:<br>We need infinity to transcend a time based understanding of<br>ourselves(our org., our thinking, our systems), and go into a<br>complxeity and chaotic based living and through that allow the<br>emergent property by all living systems: selforganization to occur.<br>In doing that we expand our human beeing and thereby we act upon<br>enlarging our worlds and again in human history open up our inner<br>bodily anchored doors to the universe and it's ruling principles.<br>And thereby we enable ourselves to live our lives with broader minds,<br>open hearts and with the ability to grab the responsibility that<br>knowledge brings.<br>My point is that as humans in this world in this universe we do live<br>more lives at the same times, simultaneously, and I strongly believe<br>that we need to be conscious about it in order to achieve from it and<br>use it. We need to expand our mental bandwidth.<br>And thereby enlarge the infinite universe within our minds<br>THAT IS OUR DEEP STARTEGY FOR SURVIVAL as a civilization, and as a<br>mind of great beauty and abundance.<br>And that our capacity as humans to deal with a multidimensional world<br>every second is our chance to enhance, to develop, to create new<br>thinkings and new perspectives on our civilizations.<br>Living for a more magical spaciouness<br>for me is a state of mind- its away of being.<br>It's a a way of living life at it's most beautiful, most lively, most<br>demanding form</p><p>And yes this, thinking about these topics, has for me some deep<br>implications of faith.<br>Yes I believe in angles and I also believe that they envy humans for<br>their ability and position within the universe to make a choice.</p><p><br>Questions I would like to pop here.<br>o Does Infinity rule us?<br>o how do we broaden our minds?<br>o all for the sake of beauty and abundance?<br>o Do our bodies reside our minds?<br>o and what about the angles?</p><p>From here to infinity,<br>May the force be with us<br>Ladies and gentlemen let's broaden our minds.<br>All for the sake of beauty and abundance<br>Inspiration:<br>o Fritoj Capra, The web of life, 1996<br>o Stuart Kaufmann, At home in the universe, 1995<br>o Arthur Young, The reflexive universe, 1976<br>o Margaret Wheatly, A simpler way, 1998<br>o Rupert Sheldrake and Matthew Fox; the physics of Angels, 1996<br>o Herman Hesse, Das Glasperlenspiel, 1946<br>o J.
